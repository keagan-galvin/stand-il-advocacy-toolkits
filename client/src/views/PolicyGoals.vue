          Dual credit courses are often students’ first experience with
          college-level coursework. Successful completion can give many students
          the confidence boost needed to continue their studies after high
          school. For other students, the low price-tag of a dual credit course
          is an excellent way to explore career pathways or get a jump start on
          the general education credits required for a postsecondary degree.
